MOMO - The Furniture Store (in progress)
Version: 1.0

About the Project:
This is the UI design of an ecommerce store built using React Js. Features of this store include a login and registration page, products page, cart and single product page.
Currently, there are no functionalities as the project is still in progress.
Other parts of the project would include an ecommerce API which would be connected to the UI design to create a full stack application.

To style this project, I used Material UI and React styled components.
