# MOMO - The Furniture Store (UI Design Only)
## Version: 1.0

## About the Project:

This is the UI design of an ecommerce store built using React Js. Features of this store include a login and registration page, products page, cart and single product page. Currently, there are no functionalities. I undertook this project to challenge my self to build a more complex front end as my previous projects have been single page react websites/applications. By building a more complex react application with multipe pages, I gained confidence in starting and building more complex react projects. 

## Technologies Used:
To style this project, I used Material UI and React styled components. The project was built with React js.

## Reflections:
-The first challenge of this project was attempting a multiple page react project when I only had experience with sinple page websites. There was a lot to taken in and learn especially when it came to structuring my folders
-Using online resources helped a lot when it came to building this project. I had just four months experience with front end engineering when I attempted this project but it stretched my capabilities as a developer and made me more confident.
- This was a project I used in practicing complex web applications but I plan to attempt building a commerce REST API which I can connect to this project to make it a full stack application. I also want to add react router to help with navigation.
- Again, I believe testing the code will make it more robust and perhaps, I could have attempted to use Test Driven Developement(TDD) principles to build a code base that is well tested, maintainable and stable.

## Further Information
As this project was a practice project, without any initial plan for deployment, the codebase is all that is available. Feel free to check out the codebase to see how the project was written and structured.
